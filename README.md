# StarWarsUniverse

Unfortunately, due to the high workload at the main job, finished the project in time

What is implemented:

- user interface
- API requests
- live search

What is not implemented:
- working with the database (due to the "AppDatabase_Impl does not exist" error, it was not possible to set up the room, now I'm looking for a solution)

Due to the non-working room, it was not possible to implement the "favorites" screen (when you go to the screen, a query is made to the database for all records that have "favorites" = true)
Also, it was not possible to fully implement adding to favorites on all screens.
